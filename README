Apache+MySQL+Php+Mediawiki Auto-installer for Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author: Thiyagaraj Krishna http://th.iy.ag / http://thiya.net

Description:

This is a NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) script that autoinstalls Apache, 
PHP, MySQL and Mediawiki. This was done when I was back in college when each computer 
in the lab required to have its standalone version of Mediawiki installed locally.

I am just uploading this for reference purpose if the silent install command line arguments
will help anyone create something similar. In the original implementation, A splash screen
will appear and then ask for a directory to install the appication to, and then it will
install Apache, MySQL, PHP and then finally Mediawiki. Mediawiki was cutomized to remove some
of the installation questions and setting defaults to them to simplify installation.

I am only uploading the installation script without the corresponding supporting software
packages.
